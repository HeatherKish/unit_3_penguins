Use the `palmerpenguins` dataset in R to answer the following questions:

Find literature values of Adelie and Chinstrap body mass. You can use the Encyclopedia of Life https://eol.org/ or find values elsewhere in the literature.

1. Are our observations of Adelie body mass significantly different from the literature?
2. Are our observations of Chinstrap body mass significantly different from the literature?
3. Are Gentoo and Chinstrap body masses significantly different?
4. Are Adelie and Chinstrap body masses significantly different from each other?

For each question, start with a bit of data exploration. Plot the data and provide summary statistics. Then explain what statistical test you are going to use and explicitly list and test the assumptions for that test. Answer each question clearly by providing a written answer that could be included in a report.
