### Linear models

Linear regression is one of the most commonly-used and easy-to-understand approaches to modeling. Linear regression involves a numerical outcome variable y and explanatory variable(s) x that are either numerical or categorical. We will start with simple (univariate) linear regression where y is modeled as a function of a single x variable.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

head(penguins)

lm_1 = lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data=penguins)
lm_2 = lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data=penguins %>% filter(species=="Gentoo"))

lm_1
summary(lm_1)
lm_2
```
